Ansible Roles for AWS Infrastructure Creation
----------------------

The purpose of these Ansible roles are to create the complete infrastructure over AWS using Ansible, which include:

- EC2 Key Pair
- Security Groups for EC2,RDS and ELB with tags
- RDS instance

I have also written so really small plugins to get the desired information.

Requirement to use these roles:

- Ansible v2.0
- boto
- AWS admin access
